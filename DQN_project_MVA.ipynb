    "$$=E_{(s',a')\\sim p(.|s,a)}[r(s,a)+\\gamma Q^{\\pi}(s',a')] $$\n",

    "### Second equation :\n",
    "With the above expression and by optimility of the policy $\\pi^*$, for a fixed state $s^*$, $Q^{\\pi^{*}}(s, a)=\\max _{a'} Q^{\\pi^{*}} (s, a')$. We note $a_{\\pi^{*}}(s)$ that maximises the quantity.\n",

    "If $Q$ is parametrized by $\\theta$, $||Q^{*}(s,a)-Q_{\\theta}(𝑠,𝑎)||^2$ will be the squared loss to minimize.
